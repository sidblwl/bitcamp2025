## Brainstorm

There should be a message board at the bottom that pops up whenever you’re not studying. Like it’ll stop the timer and be like “using your phone” it could also give you pop ups of encouraging messages

You should be able to set the rules of what qualifies as you not studying. Like sometimes I’ll use my phone to post on Instagram for S2S but I’m still being productive and doing work. So what we should do is before your study seshes you can choose what counts as not studying. For example if you open instagram, or discord, Minecraft on your computer then your not studying. And the app can detect that. You can set “not studying” stuff as your default and add things later on and then when you have group study seshes you can both/all contribute to the rules of what doesn’t count as studying

“Studying” consists of writing notes, going on elms to read lecture notes, etc. but there should also be a way to earn more xp by getting quizzes correct. Like you upload your class material it turns it into a quiz and if you’re able to get a good score you can earn even more xp points. This works because more “time” studying doesn’t always mean your productively studying but completing a quiz means you get it
So more speed running xp encourages you to study faster and get more xp rather then just siting in place and fake studying 

Same with group study. You guys can have the same class so you’ll have the same quizzes
There should probably be a separate xp for group studying so the xp has the same scale for both people

OH how about in the message que after 30 minutes it rewards you with a five minute break and you can choose to accept it or rack it up and then you can redeem it later after you’ve studying 2 hours take a 20 minute break
